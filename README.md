# systemd unit files for Atlassian products

systemd is an init daemon for Linux and is becoming a popular alternative to the traditional System V init.

Under systemd, daemons and services are started via unit files. This repository contains unit files for Atlassian products:

* jira
* confluence
* bitbucket
* crowd

These unit files assume the default install path. If you installed in a different directory you will need to adjust these files to reflect the proper path.
